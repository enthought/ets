Enthought Tool Suite
====================

The Enthought Tool Suite (ETS) is a collection of open-source components
developed by Enthought, our partners and the scientific Python community,
which we use every day to construct custom scientific applications. It
includes a wide variety of components, including:

- an `extensible application framework <http://docs.enthought.com/envisage>`_
- `application building blocks <http://docs.enthought.com/traitsui>`_
- `2-D <http://docs.enthought.com/chaco>`_ and `3-D <http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi>`_ graphics libraries
- scientific and math libraries
- developer tools

The cornerstone on which these tools rest is the `Traits <http://docs.enthought.com/traits>`_
package, which provides the observer pattern in Python; its features include
initialization, validation, delegation, notification, and visualization
of typed attributes.

    .. epigraph::

        "I set out to rebuild an application in one week that had been developed
        over the last seven years (in C by generations of post-docs). Pyface and
        Traits were my cornerstones and I knew nothing about Pyface or Wx. It has
        been a hectic week. But here … sits in front of me a nice application
        that does most of what it should. I think this has been a huge success.
        … Thanks to the tools Enthought built, and thanks to the friendly support
        from people on the [enthought-dev] list, I have been able to build what I
        think is the best application so far. I have built similar applications
        (controlling cameras for imaging Bose-Einstein condensate) in C+MFC, Matlab,
        and C+labWindows, each time it has taken me at least four times longer to
        get to a result I regard as inferior. So I just wanted to say a big "thank you".
        Thank you to Enthought for providing this great software open-source. Thank
        you for everybody on the list for your replies."

        "I'm currently writing a realtime data acquisition/display application … I'm
        using Enthought Tool Suite and Traits, and Chaco for display. IMHO, I think
        that in five years ETS/Traits will be the most comonly used framework for
        scientific applications."
